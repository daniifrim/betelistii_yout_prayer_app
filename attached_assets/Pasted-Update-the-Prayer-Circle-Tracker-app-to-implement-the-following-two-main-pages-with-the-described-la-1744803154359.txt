Update the Prayer Circle Tracker app to implement the following two main pages with the described layout, features, and design guidelines. All content and UI must be in Spanish. Use a light theme and ensure a clean, card-based layout with appropriate spacing between elements and screen edges.

1. Personal (User) Page
Layout & Components
A. Calendar (Top Section):

Display a monthly calendar at the top.

Highlight today’s date.

Mark days the user has prayed in green.

When the user checks in for today, mark today as green.

B. Inspirational Quote (Below Calendar):

Show a daily inspirational quote about prayer.

Use a preloaded list of at least 90 quotes (one per day).

The quote should update automatically each day.

C. Prayer Check-In Button (Below Quote):

Prominently display a large button labeled “He orado hoy”.

When pressed:

Mark today as prayed (green) on the calendar.

Update the user’s statistics (see below).

D. Statistics Section (Below Button):

Display the following stats in separate cards:

Racha de oración: Consecutive days prayed (streak).

Días orados este mes: Number of days prayed this month.

Total de días orados: All-time total days prayed.

E. Design Notes:

Use card-based layout for quote and statistics.

Ensure generous padding and spacing between cards and from screen edges.

All labels and content in Spanish.

Use the app’s light color palette.

2. Group Page
Layout & Components
A. Member List:

Display a list (or grid) of all group members (6 users).

For each member, show:

Name and avatar (if available).

Prayer streak (consecutive days).

Days prayed this month.

Total days prayed.

(Optional: Ranking or badge for top streaks.)

B. Design Notes:

Use card or list items for each member.

Maintain consistent padding and spacing as on the Personal Page.

All content in Spanish.

Light theme, clean and modern look.

General Guidelines
Language: All UI and content in Spanish.

Theme: Light theme only.

Design: Card-based layout, mobile-first, responsive. Use calm blue (#123458), light gray (#ecf0f1), and soft green (#48A6A7).

Spacing: Ensure cards and main elements have padding/gaps from screen edges and between each other (“let cards breathe”).

Typography: Use clear, easy-to-read fonts.

Implementation Order
Build the Personal (User) Page as described.

Then implement the Group Page.

Focus on clean layout and correct data flow for check-ins and statistics.
