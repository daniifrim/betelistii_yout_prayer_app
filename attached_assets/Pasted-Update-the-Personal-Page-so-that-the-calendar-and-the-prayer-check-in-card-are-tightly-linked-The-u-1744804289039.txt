Update the Personal Page so that the calendar and the prayer check-in card are tightly linked. The user must be able to view and change their prayer status for any selected date (past or present), not just today.

Personal Page – Calendar & Check-In Card Logic
1. Layout (Vertical Order)
A. Calendar (Top)

B. Prayer Check-In Card (Below Calendar)

C. Inspirational Quote (Below Check-In Card)

D. Statistics Section (Bottom)

2. Calendar & Check-In Card Interaction
The calendar displays the current month, with each day selectable.

When a user selects a date on the calendar (today or any previous day), the prayer check-in card below updates to reflect the prayer status for that specific date.

If the selected date is today:

The card says: “¿Has orado hoy?” (“Did you pray today?”)

Shows a button: “Marcar como orado” (“Mark as prayed”) if not already marked.

If already marked, show a confirmation (“¡Gracias por tu oración hoy!”) and an option to “Desmarcar oración” (“Unmark prayer”).

If the selected date is a previous day:

The card updates to: “¿Oraste el [fecha]?” (“Did you pray on [date]?”)

If not marked, show: “Marcar como orado”.

If already marked, show: “¡Gracias por tu oración este día!” and an option to unmark.

If the selected date is in the future:

The card should be disabled or show a message: “No puedes registrar oración para una fecha futura.” (“You cannot log prayer for a future date.”)

3. Marking/Unmarking Logic
User can mark or unmark prayer for any past or present date via the card.

When a prayer is marked, the corresponding day on the calendar turns green.

When unmarked, it returns to the default color.

Statistics update automatically based on the current state of the calendar.

4. Additional Notes
All labels and messages in Spanish.

Ensure the card and calendar are visually and functionally connected.

Prevent marking/unmarking for future dates.

Maintain all previous design and spacing guidelines.

Example User Flow
User opens the Personal Page.

The calendar shows the current month; today is highlighted.

The user selects a date (today or any previous day).

The check-in card updates to show the prayer status for that date, allowing the user to mark/unmark prayer as needed.

The calendar and statistics update in real time.

Summary:
Make sure the prayer check-in card always reflects the status of the currently selected date on the calendar, allowing users to mark or unmark their prayer for that day (except for future dates).
